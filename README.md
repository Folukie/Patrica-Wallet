# Patricia Wallet Page
## React Engineer Skill Assessment

Implementing a dashboard view for the Patricia wallet page using React and SASS/SCSS.


## Playing locally

First, you will need to install Node.js and Yarn.

After installing, navigate to the project root folder and install the project dependencies.

```$ yarn install```

Then, run the application in development mode.

```$ yarn start```

## Issues faced

After deploying on netlify, it returned a 404 error. I fixed this by adding a redirect file in the public folder.

## Todo
- Make card component accept a custom credit card number.
- Toggle credit card number visibility and blur card on card click.
